Examples for doing spatial analysis with **R** in CSC computing environment:

* [puhti](puhti) - examples for different job types in Puhti: simple serial, array and parallel: `snow`, `parallel` and `future`.
* [Working with Allas data from R](allas)
* [Reading NLS topographic database geopackage with R](geopackage)
* [R for LiDAR data](R_LiDAR) - examples and exercises
* Some R packages have in-built support for parallization, for example `raster`, `terra` and `lidR`.
  * [raster](raster_predict) - includes also the batch job (parallel) file for Puhti.
  * [lidR](R_LiDAR/R_lidar_course_exercises)
  * `terra` - just follow [terra manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/terra.pdf), see for example predict example. For batch job file see `raster` package example.
