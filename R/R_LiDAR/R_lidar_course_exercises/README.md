## R lidar exercise CSC's R lidar course
In these exercises the most basic functions of the `rlas` and `lidR` R packages by Jean-Romain are demonstrated. See the documentation for these packages from [rlas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlas/index.html) and [lidR](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/wiki).

The materials in this repository are based mostly on the above mentioned documentation with some edits and new parts to adapt them to using these libraries in CSC's Taito supercluster.

The original 2019 CSC's course page: [Lidar data analysis in Taito, with PDAL and R](https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/lidar-data-analysis-in-taito-with-pdal-and-r)

The course dataset is available in the Taito supercluster and you don't need to download it, just point to the exercise files. The path to the dataset is set to read-only to the course participants: `/wrk/gonzalez/R_lidar_2019/r_lidar_data/`

In case you need to download the dataset you can get it from: https://gis-open.object.pouta.csc.fi/r_lidar_data.zip

The most up-to-date version of the exercises is in this repository. Download the contents of this repository as a zip file to your $WRKDIR in Taito and unzip it with `unzip R_lidar_2019.zip`. Then connect to Taito using NoMachine and start RStudio. Open the `R_lidar.Rproj` project from the `r_exercise` folder you just unziped.

Note that all the necessary software packages are already installed in the Taito supercluster and thus their installation is not covered in these exercises. To see a description of the installed R spatial packages ready installed see: https://research.csc.fi/-/rspatial-env
