# Basic Lidar data management in Taito

For convinience, the full open Lidar datasets from National Land Survey of Finland (Maanmittauslaitos) have been made available in Taito. This allows researchers to directly use these datasets in their work in Taito without the need to download particular files. These datasets have been last updated in July 2017 but our goal is that in the future these datasets would be updated frequently. Other datasets are also available in Taito, to see details about the current datasets go to [GIS Data in Taito](https://research.csc.fi/gis_data_in_taito).

The following are some simple R scripts demonstrating how the Lidar dataset can be queried.

1. [Get Lidar files intersecting a given polygon](get_lidar_files.R)
1. [Basic Lidar management with ````rlas```` package](basic_rlas.R)
1. [Example batch job to run basic_rlas.R script](batchjob_rlas_basics.sh)
