# Exercise workflow

## Day 1

`scikit-learn` exercises will be done in Jupyter notebooks at CSC’s Notebooks (https://notebooks.csc.fi). Notebooks provide easy-to-use environments for working with data and programming. You can access everything via your web browser and CSC cloud environment computes on the background. 

All Python code is already in the Notebooks, data will be downloaded during the exercises.

* Point your browser to https://notebooks.csc.fi
* Login using:
	* HAKA or 
	* a CSC account (earlier Puhti/cPouta users) or 
	* Alternate login and a separate username and password, that you have recieved by e-mail
* Join "CSC-GIS-ML-Course"-group in Notebooks. Click "Account" -> "Join group" -> Insert token given during the course
* Go back to Dashboard and find *Spatial machine learning notebook* and click “Launch new”
* Wait until the “Open in browser” link appears, then click on it
* Select "Copy password and proceed"
* Copy the password to the "Password or token" field in the very beginning of the page (not the "Token" field at the bottom of the page).
* The JupyterLab notebook dashboard should appear
* Exercises: Navigate to `01_data_preparation` and open 01_vectorDataPreparations.ipynb
    * Execute the cells with *shift-enter* Continue from top to bottom.
	* If there is a star in front of the cell, the cell execution is still in progress. Some of the cells take longer time to execute.
	* If there is a number in front of the cell, the cell execution is finished.
* All exercises have numbers indicating in which order they have been planned to do.
* Only exercises from folders `01_data_preparation` and `02_shallows` are done using Notebooks.
