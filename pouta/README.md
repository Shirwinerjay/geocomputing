# Using CSC's Pouta platform for geocomputing applications
A collection of instructions to setup virtual machines in [CSC's cPouta environment](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/) for different geocomputation and general GIS related purposes. See more details in each topic's entry page:
- [OpenDroneMap as Docker applications](./docker-applications) - Install Docker and OpenDroneMap, installing other Docker applications would be very similar.
- [GeoServer](./geoserver) - Installing and using GeoServer in Pouta
- [PostGIS](./postgis) - Installing and using PostGIS in Pouta
- [ArcPy](./arcpy) - Setting up and using ArcPy in Pouta
- [MetaShape](./metashape_with_VNC) - Setting up and using MetaShape in cPouta
